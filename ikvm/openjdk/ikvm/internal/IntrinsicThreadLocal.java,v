// is to avoid having to add a remove() method to every generated class,
// but it also gives us some maneuvering room should a future JDK version
// change ThreadLocal.
// Note that because this class is abstract, getClass() on an intrinsified
// ThreadLocal instance will return java.lang.ThreadLocal instead of this class.
// We don't use HideFromJava for this, because that would make the life of
// the runtime/ikvmc more difficult (because it needs a TypeWrapper for this class).
