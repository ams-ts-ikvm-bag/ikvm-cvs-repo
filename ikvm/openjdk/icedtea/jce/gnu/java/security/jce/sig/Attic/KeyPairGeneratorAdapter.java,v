/**
 * The implementation of a generic {@@link java.security.KeyPairGenerator}
 * adapter class to wrap GNU keypair generator instances.
 * <p>
 * This class defines the <i>Service Provider Interface</i> (<b>SPI</b>) for
 * the {@@link java.security.KeyPairGenerator} class, which is used to generate
 * pairs of public and private keys.
 * <p>
 * All the abstract methods in the {@@link java.security.KeyPairGeneratorSpi}
 * class are implemented by this class and all its sub-classes.
 * <p>
 * In case the client does not explicitly initialize the KeyPairGenerator (via a
 * call to an <code>initialize()</code> method), the GNU provider supplies
 * (and document) default values to be used. For example, the GNU provider uses
 * a default <i>modulus</i> size (keysize) of 1024 bits for the DSS (Digital
 * Signature Standard) a.k.a <i>DSA</i>.
