 * never peek more then 8 bits more than needed, and you must first 
 * peek bits before you may drop them.  This is not a general purpose
 * class but optimized for the behaviour of the Inflater.

@- Switched GNU Classpath AWT/Swing back to version 0.95.
- Copied GNU Classpath version of java.text.Bidi into openjdk directory.
- Copied and integrated GNU Classpath's pure Java zip support with OpenJDK zip classes.
- Added GNU Classpath 0.95 compatible versions of awt\font.cs and awt\toolkit.cs.
