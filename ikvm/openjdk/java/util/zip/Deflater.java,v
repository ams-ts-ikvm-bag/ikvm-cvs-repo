1.2.2.1
log
@Changed version to 0.38.0.3 and backported these fixes:
- Fixed the stack trace when an unwrapped java.lang.Error (or subclass) escapes from a static initializer.
- It turns out that we really should create an MBeanServer in sun.management.ManagementFactory.createPlatformMBeanServer(), even if we don't populate it with anything useful, applications might still want to register their own MBeans. This fix allows Derby 10.4.2.0 to work.
- Added helpful message to ClassCastException generated for ghost array casts.
- Added check for constructor with missing body in map.xml.
- Removed over eager state checking from java.util.zip.Deflater. Fixes Lucene issue.
- Fixed enclosing method discovery to work for ReflectionOnly assemblies. This allows ikvmstub to work with ikvmc generated assemblies.
- Always emit an explicit method override if we've mangled the name/sig, because we can't predict whether it will be needed or not (without keeping track of the mangling in the base classes) and the cost is minimal since this doesn't happen all that often.
- Miranda method should use mangled name (if the name is mangled).
- Fixed pointer detection to work for types with multiple indirection levels.
- If the last call site of a subroutine wasn't reachable, the return switch would fall through potentially causing the code to be unverifiable.
- The check for unloadable types on the stack indexed the stack in the wrong order.
- Fixed exception wrapping for java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged().
- Fixed tracer to only add a trace listener in executables.
