@Version 1.2O, 2011/11/11

OpenJDK (the "Name") is a trademark of Oracle America, Inc. ("Oracle")
(the "Trademark Owner").

Trademark Owner publishes source code (the "Original Software") at
several World Wide Web locations (each a "Website").  These locations
include:

    http://download.java.net/openjdk/jdk6
    http://download.java.net/openjdk/jdk7
    http://download.java.net/openjdk/jdk8
    http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk6/jdk6
    http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/jdk7
    http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8

as well as any successor locations designated by Trademark Owner in
future revisions of this Notice.

Each Website provides Original Software in two parts: A Java virtual
machine (the "Virtual Machine") and an API library and tools (the
"Library and Tools").

Trademark Owner permits any person obtaining a copy of this software
(the "Software") that is based on Original Software to use the Name in
the package names and version strings of the Software subject to the
following conditions:

  (1) The Software is a substantially complete implementation of the
      OpenJDK development kit or runtime environment source code
      retrieved from a single Website, and the vast majority of the
      Software code is identical to that upstream Original Software,
      except that:

        (a) Changes required to port Original Software to new operating
            systems or hardware architectures are permitted, so long as
            that work takes place in the context of an approved Project
            hosted in the OpenJDK Community; and

        (b) A Virtual Machine from one Website may be combined with the
            Library and Tools of another Website, so long as the vast
            majority of the code in each is identical to the
            corresponding upstream Virtual Machine or Library and Tools
            component.

  (2) No permission is hereby granted to use the Name in any other
      manner, unless such use constitutes "fair use", for example
      "based on the OpenJDK source code" or "DistroXYZ's packaging of
      the OpenJDK 6 code".

  (3) Trademark Owner makes no warranties of any kind respecting the
      Name, and all representations and warranties, including any implied
      warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or
      non-infringement are hereby disclaimed.

  (4) Finally, this notice and the following legend are included in all
      copies of the Software or portions of it:

         Java and OpenJDK are trademarks or registered trademarks of
         Oracle and/or its affiliates.

Trademark Owner intends to revise this Notice as necessary in order to
meet the needs of the OpenJDK Community.  Revisions to this notice will
be announced on the public mailing list announce at openjdk.java.net, to
which you may subscribe by visiting http://mail.openjdk.java.net.  Please
send questions or comments about this Notice to the discuss list at the
same location.
