/* __ieee754_hypot(x,y)
 *
 * Method :
 *      If (assume round-to-nearest) z=x*x+y*y
 *      has error less than sqrt(2)/2 ulp, than
 *      sqrt(z) has error less than 1 ulp (exercise).
 *
 *      So, compute sqrt(x*x+y*y) with some care as
 *      follows to get the error below 1 ulp:
 *
 *      Assume x>y>0;
 *      (if possible, set rounding to round-to-nearest)
 *      1. if x > 2y  use
 *              x1*x1+(y*y+(x2*(x+x1))) for x*x+y*y
 *      where x1 = x with lower 32 bits cleared, x2 = x-x1; else
 *      2. if x <= 2y use
 *              t1*y1+((x-y)*(x-y)+(t1*y2+t2*y))
 *      where t1 = 2x with lower 32 bits cleared, t2 = 2x-t1,
 *      y1= y with lower 32 bits chopped, y2 = y-y1.
 *
 *      NOTE: scaling may be necessary if some argument is too
 *            large or too tiny
 *
 * Special cases:
 *      hypot(x,y) is INF if x or y is +INF or -INF; else
 *      hypot(x,y) is NAN if x or y is NAN.
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *      hypot(x,y) returns sqrt(x^2+y^2) with error less
 *      than 1 ulps (units in the last place)
