      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>IKVM.NET is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for the .NET and Mono runtimes. At a time when most people in the computer industry consider Java and 
        .NET as mutually exclusive technologies, IKVM.NET stands in the unique position of bringing them together. 
        Initially born out of frustration with the limitations of tools like JUMP and J#, IKVM.NET was created when Jeroen Frijters set out to 
        create a way to migrate an existing Java<sup>TM</sup> database application 
        to .NET<sup>TM</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>IKVM.NET has gone through a variety of designs and name changes to emerge as a sophisticated collection of tools offering a variety of integration patterns
        between the Java and .NET languages and platforms. It is still under development but people have reported success in running sophisticated applications and tools
        including Eclipse, JmDNS, JGroups, Jetty (with a few changes), etc.
        </p>
      <p>This manual is written for IKVM.NET version 0.36. </p>
      
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Overview</title>
      
      <p>There are two main ways of using IKVM.NET:</p>
      
       <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Dynamically: In this mode, Java classes and jars are used directly to execute Java applications on the .NET<sup>TM</sup> runtime. 
                    Java bytecode is translated on the fly into CIL and no further steps are necessary. The full Java class loader model is supported in this mode.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Statically: In order to allow Java code to be used by .NET applications, it must be compiled down to a DLL and used directly. 
                    The bytecode is translated to CIL and stored in this form. The assemblies can be referenced directly by the .NET applications and 
                    the "Java" objects can be used as if they were .NET objects. While the static mode does not support the full Java class loader mechanism, 
                    it is possible for statically-compiled code to create a class loader and load classes dynamically.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
      
      <p>
      IKVM.NET provides the VM-related technologies for byte-code translation and verification, classloading, etc. 
      It is dependent upon the <fork href="ext:openjdk">OpenJDK</fork> project 
      for implementations of the JDK libraries.</p>
      
      <p>IKVM.NET is comprised by the following components:</p>
            
             <table><caption>IKVM.NET Components</caption>
               <tr>
                   <th>Component</th>

                                    Object model remapping infrastructure: Makes System.Object, System.String and System.Exception appear to Java code as java.lang.Object, java.lang.String and java.lang.Throwable.</p>
                                </li>

      It is dependent upon the <fork href="ext:classpath">GNU Classpath</fork> project 
      for implementations of the JDK libraries. While there are several holes in the coverage provided by these libraries, they are used by at least ten open source VMs. 
      This means that they will continue evolving and being debugged rapidly to improve the quality of the IKVM.NET experience.</p>
